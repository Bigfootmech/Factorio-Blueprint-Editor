Thank you to Wube Software and the Factorio team for making Factorio. 
    It's a brilliant game, that this is a mod for.

Thank you to Nexela for his amazing "Picker Extended Version"
    The quality of life changes that it already bring to the game can't be praised enough.
    (also thank you for not having to implement them myself :P)
    
    I also borrowed some of the code style, and structure, as well as general 
    game/engine knowledge from it.

    It lets you play with blueprints from the start of the game, by allowing you to place
    actual items on a blueprint ghost from the start of the game (really useful with this mod).
    
Thank you to Choumiko for "Foreman"
    I managed to figure parts of how to work with blueprints from his code.
    I also didn't strictly get the idea for mirroring from him (I was actually infuriated in my own
    playthrough by the lack of the feature, and found his mod), his mod helped convince me to include
    it as a feature in mine.
    
Also to Killkrog, and his follow up "Killkrog's Blueprint Manager", and all the people on the forums.
    It really felt like there was a community of people asking for a functional, and feature rich
    blueprint editor in game
    
Thank you to DaveMcW, the creator of Blueprint String, who enabled this mod progression.

Thank you also to the creators of handyhands, bluebuild, kblueprints, construction tab, creative mode, 
    and shiny icons, who's mods I use for code reference if I ever get stuck, or can't make heads or
    tails of the APIs (which are pretty damn well documented. I just suck at reading/writing documentation)
