Install Tortoisegit (or favourite git distro) https://tortoisegit.org/download/
Install Lua Eclipse (or favourite dev environment) https://www.eclipse.org/ldt/
Install Python https://www.python.org/ -> downloads -> latest windows installer

(optional) Create a "Workspace" for Lua eclipse, ie: %USERPROFILE%/workspaceLua
Create a project folder, ie: 
 > %USERPROFILE%/workspaceLua/BPEdit
 
Note: all instances of %USERPROFILE% may be replaced with C:\Users\<your username> if
    you're not comfortable with using environment variables.

Git checkout the blueprint editor to your project folder (if this doesn't work, you might
    to git-fork my project on github, and substitute my username for yours in the link)
    
 > https://github.com/Bigfootmech/Factorio-Blueprint-Editor.git

Set environment variable (windows right click computer -> properties -> 
    advanced system settings -> environment variables)
    to your project folder
    
 > DEV_ENVIRONMENT = %USERPROFILE%/workspaceLua/BPEdit

Download Luarocks binary https://luarocks.github.io/luarocks/releases/ (latest win32.zip)
Open command window -> navigate to unzipped folder, and run command:

 > install /L
    
Add the luarocks and Python install folders to your PATH environment variable
 > ;C:\Program Files (x86)\LuaRocks;C:\Program Files\Python36\
 
In a new command window, run:
 > luarocks install luaunit
 
Create a new lua path environment variable that sets up links to the libraries you need
 > LUA_PATH = C:\Program Files (x86)\LuaRocks\systree\share\lua\5.1\?.lua;%DEV_ENVIRONMENT%/src;%DEV_ENVIRONMENT%/test;
 
Create Links to desktop/place you're working, to make it easier to use
 > Right click your Factorio Mods folder %USERPROFILE%/AppData/Roaming/Factorio/mods/
    , and "send to desktop (create link)"
 > Do the same for your project folder (ie %USERPROFILE%/workspaceLua/BPEdit)
 > Do the same for build.py in your project folder, then edit the shortcut
    , by clicking "properties", and replace target with
 > "C:\Program Files\Python36\python.exe" "%USERPROFILE%/workspaceLua/BPEdit/build.py"
    Then go back in to properties -> Advanced -> Tick "run as administrator"
    This will allow the build script to create "links" from your Factorio/mods folder back to your
        dev environment, so that you don't have to redeploy, unless you change keybinds
        
OPTIONALLY:
Create batch files called "py.bat" inside 
 > C:\Program Files\Python36
containing
 > python %*
and "lua.bat" in
 > C:\Program Files (x86)\LuaRocks
containing
 > lua5.1 %*
This will redirect py in the console to python, and lua will redirect to lua3.1
    , which means you have to type less/remember less on a regular basis.
    
You should now be able to click your "build" shortcut.

This will test, and build the project (result files are in "Target" in the project folder)
As well as deploying to your mods folder in a clever way, if you allowed admin permissions.

In eclipse, you should also be able to import the project, or 
"create lua project", then move the files over.

You should also right click srd, and test folders -> build path -> use as source folder
