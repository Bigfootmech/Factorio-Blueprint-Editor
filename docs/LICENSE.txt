English(for those of us not fluent in legalese):
-Do whatever you want
-If anything goes wrong, I'm not materially responsible (You won't chase me for money. 
    I don't have any anyway.) :P. But if you ask nicely, I can try to help. 
    It's a homemade mod for a game in alpha. You really can't expect much from it.
-Legally, I can't waive my right to be credited if you use this work. But I won't chase you either. 
    Any credits, I would appreciate, but plagiarize/borrow/reappropriate/acquire... etc to your heart's content.
-Please don't (try to) impersonate me. [not binding, but polite]
-Please don't copy this project, and change the name of the project to something very 
    similar (eg:Bluepront Editor), or to imply it's more directly tied to me (eg: Bigfootmech's 
    Blueprint Editor) than my own copy. [not binding, but polite]
