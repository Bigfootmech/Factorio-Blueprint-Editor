# Blueprint Editor!

 - Pick up a blueprint, and "assign" it for editing with N (editable), while it's in your hand. 
  -- This should open up the familiar "blueprint edit" screen, but with additional (hidden) features.
  -- If there isn't a blueprint in your hand, the BPEdit will try to open the interface for a 
    blueprint you're already editing (if it's accidentally closed).

 - "Quick open" inventory for easier access to your existing blueprints by hitting "N" again.
  
 - Pick up another blueprint (with only 1 item), and add it to the blueprint with Shift-N (editable). 
  -- It should now appear on the blueprint you are editing.

 - Move it around until you are satisfied with up-down-left-right (editable)
  -- You should see it moving in "real time".
  -- Use "Shift" to move items further.
  
 - Press "CAPS LOCK" to "anchor" your blueprint to the new element. When placing, your blueprint
    will now orientate around that (rather than in the centre of the blueprint)

 - Stop editing by clicking "tick" button, or selecting a different blueprint for editing.


Notes: 
 - Not tested with full inventory
 - Not tested with combinators / other "oblong" shapes
 - Not tested if it preserves wires
 - Not tested in multiplayer.
 - Not tested with other mods / bob's stuff
 - May have command incompatibility with Picher Extended - Dollies!
 - Can't check if "tick" button is on the correct/coresponding gui.
 - not fully tested (using something that's not a blueprint in your hand with these commands) yet.
