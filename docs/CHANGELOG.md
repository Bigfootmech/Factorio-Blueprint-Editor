TODO:
ALL THE THINGS

0.1.2 (2017.10.29)
Fixed a bug where commands weren't showing up/editable in the commands/mods menu
Made deployment semi-automatic, and added file generation. Should be no more screwing with bugs like that, 
    and deployments should now be easier for me. As well as having a nicer-looking directory structure in git.

0.1.1 (2017.10.28)
(hopefully) Fixed a bug eradicator found, with directions.
(behind the scenes) Changed "Table" to be "Map", as that's what I see it as.

0.1.0 (2017.10.27)
First fast out-the-door entry.

It will kind-of work. But expect it to be nothing short of unstable garbage.

DO NOT USE if you aren't comfortable with your game crashing.

Read the Readme for instructions of how to use it.

0.0.3
Rewriting a bunch of the core code to be more standardized. 
Stdlib rejected as a concept, because it doesn't implement the things I need in the way I need them.
It would be more effort to repurpose it for my project than making my own.

Directory structure improved
License chosen in anticipation of "public release"
Docs added to main folder

Somewhere along the lines I was thinking "well THIS is just a showcase..." at which point I realized that I'd done that a couple of times already.
Which means this is now the "third" iteration. ie:0.0.3, even though it hasn't seen the light of day yet.

I may go through more, depending on how I feel about the data-preservation for blueprints.
(I don't, don't, DON'T want people to freak out because I destroyed their blueprints. Because that's exactly what I'd do.)
(I'm also really lazy, and don't want to have to deal with data migrations yet, if I can help it)

0.0.2
Creating basic mod

Currently, a botch job. 
It will LET you edit blueprints. 
But I won't promise that it will be good.

Discovered a show-stopper bug where I was holding on to the hand, rather than a specific blueprint.
