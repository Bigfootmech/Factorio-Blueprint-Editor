# Blueprint Editor!

Note: due to compatibility with Dollies from Picker Extended:
This will only work if there's nothing in your "selection" when you press u/d/l/r buttons 
(ie: you're not mousing over an object in the world)


 - Pick up a blueprint, and "assign" it for editing with N (editable), while it's in your hand. 
  -- This should open up the familiar "blueprint edit" screen, but with additional features.

 - Pick up another blueprint (with only 1 item), and add it to the blueprint with Shift-N (editable). 
  -- It should now appear on the blueprint you are editing.

 - Move it around until you are satisfied with up-down-left-right (editable)
  -- You should see it moving in "real time".

 - Finalize by clicking "tick" button, or selecting a different blueprint for editing.

Not yet tested in multiplayer.
