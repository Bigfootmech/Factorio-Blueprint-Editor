# Blueprint Editor!

 - Pick up a blueprint, and "assign" it for editing with N (editable), while it's in your hand. 
  -- This should open up the familiar "blueprint edit" screen, but with additional (hidden) features.
  -- If there isn't a blueprint in your hand, the BPEdit will try to open the interface for a blueprint you're already editing (if it's accidentally closed).

 - Pick up another blueprint (with only 1 item), and add it to the blueprint with Shift-N (editable). 
  -- It should now appear on the blueprint you are editing.

 - Move it around until you are satisfied with up-down-left-right (editable)
  -- You should see it moving in "real time".
  -- Use "Shift" to move items further.

 - Stop editing by clicking "tick" button, or selecting a different blueprint for editing.


Notes: 
 - May have command incompatibility with Picher Extended - Dollies!
 - Not yet tested in multiplayer.
 - Doesn't currently check if "tick" button is on the correct gui.
